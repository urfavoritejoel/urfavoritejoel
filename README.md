## Joel Motes ðŸ‘‹

   Hello, Iâ€™m Joel, and I have a passion for all things creative. Iâ€™ve done work on writing stories, shows, making music, shooting videos, and most importantly, software development.
   I have trained through the App Academy bootcamp, and this taught me many techniques to help grow my creative skills. I am a swift learner, and I strive for continuing education in this field. No matter what challenge any particular job may present, I can be confident that Iâ€™ll learn the ins and outs quickly, and, if needed, find ways to optimize the process.
   In addition, Iâ€™ve spent years now as a comedian specializing in improvisation, or improv. The greatest skills Iâ€™ve learned from countless improv shows is working with a group of talented people to support each other. The most important concept in improv is to make your team members look good. Iâ€™m not the only star of the show, we all are.
   Iâ€™ve applied this concept to jobs, since working as a team is extremely important, and I always reach out a hand to help all coworkers stay on even ground. Looking forward to the next team Iâ€™m working on.
